Her project is an ethnography of translation interested chiefly in the interpretation of medieval Sanskrit Buddhist texts for contemporary transnational audiences.

## Khenpo Kunga Sherab

Khenpo Kunga joined the Department for the Study of Religion at the University of Toronto as a PhD student in 2016. His research is in the area of contemporary Tibetan Buddhist scholars’ engagement with science with a particular interest in Buddhist and contemporary scientific theories of consciousness, karma and reincarnation.

He received an MA, also from the DSR, in 2014. Khenpo has worked at the DSR since 2009 both as a course instructor of Tibetan language and as a Research Consultant, assisting with student and faculty research and teaching in Tibetan Studies.

## Matt Price

As a historian of science and technology, Matt has been interested in the social impacts of technologies his whole adult life. His interest in digital technology emerged partly out of his research (especially on early cybernetics, in the 1950s and 1960s) and partly from his practical engagement teaching technical skills to kids and people in social housing. HIs hope in much of his teaching is that students come away, first, with a sense of how digital technologies can both enhance and diminish what some philosophers have called “human flourishing” and others “emancipation”; and second, equipped with the tools they need to help nudge our society along in the right direction.

## Frances Garrett

Frances' research has examined the intersections between tantric practice, ritual and occult knowledge and medical theory, and what these tell us about the processes of institutional and ideological change in Tibet. She has also worked on the Tibetan King Gesar epic. Most recently in her teaching, with a team of colleagues and students she has developed an online Classical Tibetan language course, and she is co-founder (with Matt Price) of University of Toronto Outdoors.
