Join us for a presentation by visiting graduate student, Kikee D. Bhutia, with an overview of her doctoral research:

> In the Eastern Himalayan belt of the northeastern part of India lies the second smallest state of the Indian Union, Sikkim. It sits between the Tibet Autonomous Region to the north, Bhutan to the west and Nepal to the east. Until 1975, Sikkim was an independent Himalayan Kingdom, ruled by monarchs who were descendants of Tibetans. In July 2016, Sikkim's Khangchendzonga National Park, with its sacred landscape and rich biodiversity, was included as a World Heritage Site under the "mixed" category, recognizing its importance in both nature and culture.

>The main focus of my paper is to situate the sacred landscape of Sikkim according to belief narratives that revolve around the arrival of Guru Padmasambhava, also known as Guru Rimpoche or the Second Buddha.  It is believed that when Guru Padmasambhava was on his way to Tibet, he passed the Hidden Land of Demojong (Valley of Rice, or Valley of Fruits) and sanctified the land, taming supernatural beings by turning them into the guardian deities of the land and hiding terma (Buddhist religious scriptures) in different parts of the land. I will discuss how these myths sanctified the landscape and drew the sacred geography of the land, and how these became pilgrimage places for the people of Sikkim.

>My focus lies on contemporary spirituality and local belief narratives about sacred landscapes, and on how pilgrimage plays a vital role in maintaining, continuing and renewing these belief systems. This paper is an introduction to Sikkim and my research work as a whole.

Kikee D Bhutia is a PhD candidate at the Department of Estonian and Comparative Folklore, University of Tartu. Before joining Tartu, she worked as a Research Assistant in Namgyal Institute of Tibetology, Gangtok (Sikkim, India). At Namgyal Institute, she was involved in various projects including transcription, translation and transmission of oral histories and proverbs and also assisting in ethnographic documentary filmmaking.

Her research focuses on belief narratives regarding yul lha gzhi bdag (guardian deities), in Sikkim, and particularly seeks to draw out the relational principles that connect these deities with villagers in their everyday life. Her research is an exploration of the beliefs, values, stories and rituals she grew up with, and so she sees her research as both an academic endeavour and a quest for discovering and understanding ‘the self’.

## February 6, 2018: Aadil Brar on "Heritage Without People: UNESCO World Heritage and the Bureaucracy of Development"

As India’s first “mixed” World Heritage site, the Khangchendzonga National Park, was recognized by UNESCO for both its natural and cultural significance. The listing — meant to be a recognition of “deep cultural meanings and sacred significance” — was celebrated by the government, local officials, and the tourism industry. But where are the people who called the KNP their home? This seven-month investigative research revealed a complicated story of forest dwellers being displaced, bureaucratic control, and tourism driven heritage management. This talk will delve on the impact of UNESCO World Heritage program in Sikkim, and examine the role of Forest, Environment and Wildlife Management Department in forest and cultural heritage management. Brar will also discuss the Forest Rights Act of 2006 in context of Sikkim and India.
