In Toronto, Frances Garrett, Khenpo Kunga Sherab, and Dakpa Gyatso have been studying Tibetan language guidebooks to hidden lands (_sbas yul_). An international workshop on ["Hidden Lands in Himalayan Myth and History: Transformations of Beyul (sBas yul) through Time"](http://buddhiststudies.utoronto.ca/events/hiddenlands/) was held in Toronto in December 2017, featuring thirteen paper presentations; this research is now being prepared as an edited volume.
