In Toronto, Frances Garrett, Khenpo Kunga Sherab, and Dakpa Gyatso have been studying Tibetan language guidebooks to Sikkim as a hidden land (_sbas yul_). Translation work and publications related to this research should start to be available in 2019.

An international workshop on ["Hidden Lands in Himalayan Myth and History: Transformations of Beyul (sBas yul) through Time"](http://buddhiststudies.utoronto.ca/events/hiddenlands/) was held in Toronto in December 2017, featuring thirteen paper presentations. This research is now being prepared as an edited volume.

In Sikkim, Anna Balikci-Denjongpa is working with monks from Pemayangtse monastery on a book that documents sacred sites in the Khangchendzonga National Park and the environs.
