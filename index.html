  <h1>About the Project</h1>
  <p>With funding from the Canadian SSHRC Insight grant program, a five-year project entitled &ldquo;Expeditions to Paradise: Sacred Travel in the Himalaya&rdquo; is exploring how the world&rsquo;s highest mountains are constructed as &lsquo;sacred.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Our goal is to map religious expression in written and oral depictions of Himalayan travel. In particular, we hope to shed light on how historical and contemporary travelogues, guidebooks and guiding discourses construct mountains as sacred, utopian, or otherwise religiously empowered; to reveal how individual transnational encounters define mountains in religious or spiritual terms, as expressed in oral histories of pilgrims, mountaineers, and residents of the Himalayan foothills; and to develop a history of Himalayan travel depicted as pilgrimage by local and international communities, contributing a globally informed perspective on sacred space and travel.</p>

<p>Our primary field site is Mt Khangchendzonga, straddling India and Nepal, which was recognized by UNESCO as a natural and cultural World Heritage Site in 2016. This mountain has been the subject of guidebook writing in Tibetan since the fourteenth century, and local and international communities continue to produce guides to the region. We hope to add to the understanding of guidebooks and travel past and present, and examine how European and Asian forms of expeditionary travel have global impact.</p>

<p>While researchers are actively studying the construction of sacred space in many cultures, few have addressed the mapping of paradisal lands across the Himalayas. Despite the rapid rise of adventure travel in the Himalayas, moreover, little is known about the encounter between local climbers, local residents, and international mountaineers. We hope to explore how sacred spaces are constructed by inflections of power and transnational forces, how religious practices interact with the environment, and how stories embedded in local landscapes shape a traveler&rsquo;s experience.</p>

<p>The project will involve text-historical, archival, and oral history research in Canada, the US, UK, Germany, India, and Nepal. Project researchers at University of Toronto include <a href="http://francesgarrett.chass.utoronto.ca/">Frances Garrett</a> and <a href="https://outdoors.hackinghistory.ca/team_member/matt-price/">Matt Price</a>. Project partners include Anna Balikci-Denjongpa at the Namgyal Institute of Tibetology in Gangtok, East Sikkim, and the Khangchendzonga Conservation Committee (KCC) in Yuksam, West Sikkim.</p>

<p>This project is designed around student and citizen engagement, drawing on models of public history and community-based research. In 2016 and 2017, Garrett and Price taught a month-long <a href="https://sikkim.hackinghistory.ca/">immersive field course</a> in Sikkim that focused on Buddhist pilgrimage travel, the influence of rivers on Himalayan cultures, and the interplay between religious institutions and environmental sustainability movements in the region. In the summer of 2017, undergraduate Study of Religion student Damien Boltauzer worked with the KCC in Yuksam on digitizing their archival materials.</p>

<p>This year, students in Matt Price&rsquo;s undergraduate course at University of Toronto, <a href="https://2017.hackinghistory.ca/">Hacking History</a>, continue to work with the KCC leadership and staff and their archival materials. Damien Boltauzer continues to catalog our growing database of images, recordings, and archival documents. With Frances Garrett and Khenpo Kunga Sherab, students in the Department for the Study of Religion are reading Tibetan language guidebooks to hidden lands (<em>sbas yul</em>). In Sikkim, Anna Balikci-Denjongpa is working with monks from Pemayangtse monastery on documenting sacred sites in the Khangchendzonga National Park and environs.</p>

<p>Join us for a presentation by visiting graduate student, Kikee D. Bhutia, with an overview of her doctoral research:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the Eastern Himalayan belt of the northeastern part of India lies the second smallest state of the Indian Union, Sikkim. It sits between the Tibet Autonomous Region to the north, Bhutan to the west and Nepal to the east. Until 1975, Sikkim was an independent Himalayan Kingdom, ruled by monarchs who were descendants of Tibetans. In July 2016, Sikkim&rsquo;s Khangchendzonga National Park, with its sacred landscape and rich biodiversity, was included as a World Heritage Site under the &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; category, recognizing its importance in both nature and culture.</p>

<p>The main focus of my paper is to situate the sacred landscape of Sikkim according to belief narratives that revolve around the arrival of Guru Padmasambhava, also known as Guru Rimpoche or the Second Buddha.  It is believed that when Guru Padmasambhava was on his way to Tibet, he passed the Hidden Land of Demojong (Valley of Rice, or Valley of Fruits) and sanctified the land, taming supernatural beings by turning them into the guardian deities of the land and hiding terma (Buddhist religious scriptures) in different parts of the land. I will discuss how these myths sanctified the landscape and drew the sacred geography of the land, and how these became pilgrimage places for the people of Sikkim.</p>

<p>My focus lies on contemporary spirituality and local belief narratives about sacred landscapes, and on how pilgrimage plays a vital role in maintaining, continuing and renewing these belief systems. This paper is an introduction to Sikkim and my research work as a whole.</p>

<p>Kikee D Bhutia is a PhD candidate at the Department of Estonian and Comparative Folklore, University of Tartu. Before joining Tartu, she worked as a Research Assistant in Namgyal Institute of Tibetology, Gangtok (Sikkim, India). At Namgyal Institute, she was involved in various projects including transcription, translation and transmission of oral histories and proverbs and also assisting in ethnographic documentary filmmaking.</p>

<p>Her research focuses on belief narratives regarding yul lha gzhi bdag (guardian deities), in Sikkim, and particularly seeks to draw out the relational principles that connect these deities with villagers in their everyday life. Her research is an exploration of the beliefs, values, stories and rituals she grew up with, and so she sees her research as both an academic endeavour and a quest for discovering and understanding ‘the self’.</p>

<p>As India’s first “mixed” World Heritage site, the Khangchendzonga National Park, was recognized by UNESCO for both its natural and cultural significance. The listing — meant to be a recognition of “deep cultural meanings and sacred significance” — was celebrated by the government, local officials, and the tourism industry. But where are the people who called the KNP their home? This seven-month investigative research revealed a complicated story of forest dwellers being displaced, bureaucratic control, and tourism driven heritage management. This talk will delve on the impact of UNESCO World Heritage program in Sikkim, and examine the role of Forest, Environment and Wildlife Management Department in forest and cultural heritage management. Brar will also discuss the Forest Rights Act of 2006 in context of Sikkim and India.</p>
