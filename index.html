<p>With funding from the Canadian SSHRC Insight grant program, this five-year project entitled &ldquo;Expeditions to Paradise: Sacred Travel in the Himalaya&rdquo; is exploring how the world&rsquo;s highest mountains are constructed as &lsquo;sacred.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Our goal is to map religious expression in written and oral depictions of Himalayan travel. We hope to shed light on how historical and contemporary travelogues, guidebooks and guiding discourses construct mountains as sacred, utopian, or otherwise religiously empowered; to reveal how individual transnational encounters define mountains in religious or spiritual terms, as expressed in oral histories of pilgrims, mountaineers, and residents of the Himalayan foothills; and to develop a history of Himalayan travel depicted as pilgrimage by local and international communities, contributing a globally informed perspective on sacred space and travel.</p>

<p>Our primary site is Mt Khangchendzonga, straddling India and Nepal, which was recognized by UNESCO as a natural and cultural World Heritage Site in 2016. This mountain has been the subject of guidebook writing in Tibetan since the fourteenth century, and local and international communities continue to produce guides to the region. We hope to add to the understanding of guidebooks and travel past and present, and examine how European and Asian forms of expeditionary travel have global impact. We hope to explore how mountain spaces are constructed by inflections of power and transnational forces, how religious practices interact with the environment, and how stories embedded in local landscapes shape a traveler&rsquo;s experience.</p>

<p>The project involves text-historical, archival, and oral history research in Canada, the US, UK, Germany, India, and Nepal. Project researchers are located at University of Toronto in Canada, and in India at the Namgyal Institute of Tibetology in Gangtok, East Sikkim, and the Khangchendzonga Conservation Committee (KCC) in Yuksam, West Sikkim.</p>

<h2 id="student-training-and-community-engagement">Student training and community engagement</h2>

<p>This project is designed around student and citizen engagement, drawing on models of public history and community-based research. From 2016-2018, Garrett and Price taught an <a href="https://sikkim.hackinghistory.ca/">immersive field course</a> in Sikkim that focused on Buddhist pilgrimage travel, the influence of rivers on Himalayan cultures, and the interplay between religious institutions and environmental sustainability movements in the region.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2017, undergraduate Study of Religion student Damien Boltauzer worked with the KCC in Yuksam on digitizing their archival materials. Over the summer of 2018, Damien Boltauzer investigated a 29km pilgrimage route (<em>gnas skor</em>) around the peak of Drilburi in the Lahaul region of northern Himachal Pradesh (near the border with Ladakh), near Keylong and the ancient gompa of Gandhola/Guru Ghantal. This pilgrimage occurs on the full moon of June. Damien is now studying and working in Nepal for the academic year.</p>

<p>In 2017-18, students in Matt Price&rsquo;s undergraduate course at University of Toronto, <a href="https://2017.hackinghistory.ca/">Hacking History</a>, continued to work with the KCC leadership and staff and their archival materials. Damien Boltauzer continued to catalog the growing database of images, recordings, and archival documents. In May 2018, Garrett, Price, and six undergraduate students from University of Toronto traveled to West Sikkim to meet with KCC leadership and to lead a web development skills workshop for KCC staff and local community members.</p>

<p>The partnership between U of T and the KCC has led to the beginnings in 2018 of a project called <a href="https://code-at-the-edge.github.io/">Code at the Edge</a>, which is developing a web development curriculum appropriate to the mountain region, to be piloted at the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalay School for Girls in Labang, West Sikkim.</p>

<h2 id="text-historical-research">Text-historical research</h2>

<p>In Toronto, Frances Garrett, Khenpo Kunga Sherab, and Dakpa Gyatso have been studying Tibetan language guidebooks to hidden lands (<em>sbas yul</em>). An international workshop on <a href="http://buddhiststudies.utoronto.ca/events/hiddenlands/">&ldquo;Hidden Lands in Himalayan Myth and History: Transformations of Beyul (sBas yul) through Time&rdquo;</a> was held in Toronto in December 2017, featuring thirteen paper presentations; this research is now being prepared as an edited volume.</p>

<p>In Sikkim, Anna Balikci-Denjongpa is working with monks from Pemayangtse monastery on documenting sacred sites in the Khangchendzonga National Park and the environs.</p>
